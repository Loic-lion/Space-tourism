            <span>
              A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a
              blunt-body reentry capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere
              without wings. Our capsule is where you'll spend your time during
              the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, and plenty of other
              activities to keep you entertained.
